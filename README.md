<h5 align="center">What is AmityCoin?

_<p align="center"> Amity, meaning "friendly relations", hopes to bring exactly what it means. With this unique and prospective coin, we hope to achieve that. AmityCoin brings you a crypto currency you can feel safe using. With it's privacy, their is no way anybody could trace a transaction back to you. This would be ideal if you don't want people knowing your expenses as other Blockchains are public and can be viewed by anybody. Also, with it's adaptability we hope to bring AmityCoin on various operating systems like Android, iOS, Windows and more. With this, it can easily be adapted to everyday life for example, paying for your weekly shop or even topping your phone up or if you have enough, buy a car or a home. Whilst being ASIC resistant every coin is equally fair to mine because it favours CPU mining, however little that may be. AmityCoin is new form private cryptocurrency. Amity hope to achieve a truly decentralized network/currency to give people the freedom of holding their own money. You will be in charge of your AMITs, not a bank._
